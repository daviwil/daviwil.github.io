I recently learned of a Linux distribution called <a href="http://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>.  Its website
describes it as a &quot;purely functional&quot; Linux distribution.  Since I&#39;m a
fan of functional programming, the concept of a functional Linux
distribution intrigued me.  Even though I was fairly happy with my
<a href="http://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> install, I decided to give NixOS a shot to see if it lived
up to its promise.  The bottom line is that NixOS and the Nix package
manager are fantastic but a few issues made me switch back to Arch
temporarily until I can get them sorted out.
