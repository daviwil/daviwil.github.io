### NOTES

Tweets are too short to paint a clear picture of who you are.

Having a lot of GitHub repos is nice, but it's also good to explain the motivation
behind your projects and what you learned from them.

A website is your business card on the web.

Your posts are a record of the things that you've been learning whether you
released something or not.
